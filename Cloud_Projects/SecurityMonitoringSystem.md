# Build a Security  Monitoring System

Create alerts for when your senstitve informaiton is accessed using AWS CloudTrail, CloudWatch and SNS.

## Motivation:
Keep track of who accessing sensitive informaiton/data in AWS where its API keys, database credentials, or other critical  secrets. Its a security risk everytime someone access your informaiton.

In this project we will demonstrate how to set up a monitoring system in AWS using CloudTrail, CloudWatch and SNS!, We're doing this project to leaen how securtiy and monitoring services in AWS work, plus have a working system that actually send us emails too.  

## Secret Mannager :
A servide in AWS use to store sensative information like database credentials, account IDs, API keys... anything that is sensitive information that would cause damage/trouble if it got leaked and shouldn't be lying around in code.
Secret Manager uses an enxryption service called AWS KMS(Key Management Service) to encrypt your secrets, so your secret can√Ñt be read by anyone without the right access.  

## CloudTrail

CloudTrail is a monitoring service- it recode the events that happeing in AWS account, like creating resources, updating name or setting... and accessing secrets in Secret Mannager. 
To track envents that happen in our account. This will help us to catch logs of who, when and how someone accessed (opens) a secret. This Continous recoding is super valuable for security , troubleshooting and meeting compliance requirements.

CloudTrail events include types like mannagement, data, insights and network activity events. In this project, we set up our trail to track Management events because accesssing a secret falls into that category. It is not a data event( 
which is captures high volum actions performed on recources) because amnnagment events are free to track. 

Accessing secret is cosiered as write activity because of its importance.

## Steps

1)  We save the secrets in Secret Manager in AWs
2)  Than created a S3 bucket for that

Then created Trail of CloudTrail and attach that S3 bucket with it. 

To access Secret through:

-  Secret Manager Console
-  Command line you write this (AWS CLI or your CLI tool) 

```
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id "YOUR-SECRET-ID" --region YOUR-REGION
```
Then you can access your secrets.
3)  Now check the EventHistory in CloudTrail we can see information about accesssing Secrete Keys.
## CloudWatch

It will help us to do deeper analyses with out logs and with creating matxies to track how many times an event happen.

4)   Enable CloudWatch Logs in CloudTrails:
  Amazon CloudWatch Logs is a service that helps you bring together your logs from differet AWS services, including CloudTrail, for visiblity, troubleshooting and analysis. It's especially powerful because once your logs are in CloudWatch, you can create alerts based on specific patterns bisualize trends, or trigger automated responses.

### CloudWatch Vs CloudTrail:

CloudTrail's Event History is useful for quickly eading (management) events that  happened in the last 90 days, whicle CloudWatch Logs are etter for combining and analysing logs from different sources, accessing logs fro longer than 90 days and advance filtering 

6)   Add a filter in Cloudwatch
7)   Setup CloudWatch Alaram and SNS:
   The CloudWatch alarm goes off i.e. it detect when something's wrong/something exceeds a defined threshold, whereas SNS notifies i.e. it tells you that something is gone wrong.
-   Create a Cloudwatch alarm : which is a freature and alert system wheihc is designed to goe off i.e. indicate when certain condiions have been met in our log group
-   In Alarm Configure actions: set notification service
